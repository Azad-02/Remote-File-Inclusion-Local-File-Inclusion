SQL (Structured Query Language) Injection is an attack on a web application database server that causes malicious queries to be executed. When a 
web application communicates with a database using input from a user that hasn't been properly validated, there runs the potential of an attacker 
being able to steal, delete or alter private and customer data and also attack the web applications authentication methods to private or customer areas.

WHAT IS SQL INJECTION?
The point wherein a web application using SQL can turn into SQL Injection is when user-provided data gets included in the SQL query.

EXAMPLE:

URL for blog-
URL - https://website.thm/blog?id=1	#ach blog entry has a unique id number. 
					#The blog entries may be either set to public or private depending on whether they're ready for public release.
					#blog entry been selected comes from the id parameter in the query string.

SQL statement for retrieving above blog can be-
> SELECT * from blog where id=1 and private=0 LIMIT 1;

Let's pretend article id 2 is still locked as private, so it cannot be viewed on the website. 
We could now instead call the URL:
URL - https://website.thm/blog?id=2;--

Which can produce the SQL statement:
> SELECT * from blog where id=2;-- and private=0 LIMIT 1; 	#The semicolon in the URL signifies the end of the SQL statement, and the two dashes 
								 cause everything afterwards to be treated as a comment.
The actual query run in DB is:
> SELECT * from blog where id=2;--

TYPES OF SQL-Injection

	1. In-Band SQLi
	2. Blind SQli
	3. Out Of Band SQli

1. In-Band SQL Injection:
   Easiest type to detect and exploit.
   Refers to the same method of communication being used to Exploit the vulnerability and also Receive the results.
Ex. discovering an SQL Injection vulnerability on a website page and then being able to extract data from the database to the same page.

	a. Error-Based SQL Injection
	   Most useful for easily obtaining information about the database structure as error messages from the database are printed directly 
	   to the browser screen. 
	   This can often be used to enumerate a whole database. 

	b. Union-Based SQL Injection
	   Utilises the SQL UNION operator alongside a SELECT statement to return additional results to the page. 
	   This method is the most common way of extracting large amounts of data via an SQL Injection vulnerability.
