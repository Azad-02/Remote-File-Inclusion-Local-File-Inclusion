PREVENTING LFI ATTACKS

An approach to eliminate the risk of LFI attacks is to disallow or prevent user-submitted input from being passed to any filesystem or framework API 
in your application. If that is not possible and you need that functionality, then make sure all user-input is properly sanitized.

Here are a few easy steps you can take to prevent LFI attacks:

        - ID assignation – always save your file paths in a secure database. Give an ID for every single one. By doing so, users only get to see the ID
        - Whitelisting – ignore everything that is not a verified and secured whitelist file
        - Use databases – use a database instead of including files on a web server that can be compromised
        - Better server instructions – configure the server so it sends the download headers automatically instead of executing files in a specified 
          directory
