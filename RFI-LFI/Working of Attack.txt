How does an LFI Attack Work :


A Local File Inclusion can occur when an application includes a file as user input without properly validating it. This flaw enables an attacker to include malicious files by manipulating the input.

- The following vulnerable PHP code could lead to LFI:
        
        https://website-example.com/?page=filename.php

If there is improper input sanitization, an attacker can easily modify the input and manipulate the application into accessing unauthorized files and directories from the host server by using the “../” directive. 

- This is known as Directory or Path Traversal:
        
        https://website-example.com/?page=../../../../etc/test.txt


-- The most popular target for an LFI attack is a file containing USERNAMES and PASSWORDS.

For example:

        http://www.example_target_website.com/download.php?file=document.html

For any attacker, this is a jackpot. Why? Well, to begin with, the request directly accesses the file system, and it can be changed to something arbitrary like:

        http://www.example_target_website.com/download.php?file=../../../../etc/passwd

With a bit of luck, an attacker could gain access to usernames and passwords, with obvious repercussions.
