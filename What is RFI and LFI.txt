-> Remote File Inclusion (RFI)

A Type of vulnerability found in PHP running websites or web servers. The RFI enables an attacker to include the remotely hosting file however through scripting on the website servers and vulnerability occurring due to usage of its user-supplied user input without final validations through it.

RFI is the attacker’s targeted code for the malware attack in website server applications that reference outer external scripts(Just like Backdoor Shells).

In Remote File Inclusion RFI attacks, hackers take the merits of the “dynamic file including” commands that are in such website/ web portal applications to send malicious external files or scripts to it.

The malicious malware file execution of attacks can be done with Blacklisting as well as Code fixing within it.
        - The perpetrator can be executing malicious code from an external source instead of accessing a file on the local web servers, as is the 
           case with an LFI attack
        - The goal is to exploit the insecurity of local files uploaded on functions that fail to validate user-supplied/controlled inputs



-> Local File Inclusion (LFI)

Same as RFI, the only difference is in LFI the attacker has to upload the malicious scripts to target the server-side to be executed by it locally. local file inclusion (LFI) is uploading malicious files to web servers via web browsers.

This enabled an attacker to include malicious files by manipulating the input. LFI uses local files (i.e, files executing on the end target on the server’s handling) when it is excluding the attacks.

NOTE :: Remote File Inclusion (RFI) and Local File Inclusion (LFI) are vulnerabilities that are found on poorly-written web servers sides or website applications. Thus these malware vulnerabilities occur when a web application enabled the user to submit input into files or upload files to the servers

Malicious file executing running attacks can be done with Vulnerability scans and on Web Application firewalls:

        - LFI is possible for third party hackers to only usable at once an owner’s website browsing to get out of the harmful attacks.
        - RFI attack is having perpetrators that examine malicious targeted code from external resources of accessing the file on the local 
           webserver within to LFI attacks through it.
        - LFI has goals to explain the insecurities of local files that are uploaded to stored functions that fail to validate 
           user-supplied/controlled inputs.

LFI attack may lead to information disclosure, remote code execution, or even Cross-site Scripting (XSS).

INCLUDE() Function is Vulnerable in PHP for LFI Vulnerability.


-- Directory Traversal --

An attacker can a Directory Traversal / Path Traversal attack using an LFI vulnerability

EX - http://example.com/?file=../../../../etc/passwd
